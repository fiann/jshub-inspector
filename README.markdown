# jsHub tag activity inspector #

The Inspector adds a "jsHub Tag" tab to [Firebug][]. The Firebug extension allows you to view the events which are generated by a [jsHub][] tag.


# Extension development #
The extension code is in the `public/xpi` folder. 


# Web application #
There's a simple web application wrapper, coded with [Sinatra][]. The wrapper has code to ZIP the extension files into a `.xpi` archive for installing into your browser.

To start the web app:

    sudo gem install sinatra
    sudo gem install sinatra-static-assets
    ruby inspector.rb

You can also use [Passenger][] to deploy the application on a sub-path of an Apache server. There is a Rack-compliant `config.ru` file in the root of the folder.
