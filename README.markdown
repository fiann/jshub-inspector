# jsHub tag activity inspector #

Web application is coded with [Sinatra][]. 

To start the web app:

    sudo gem install sinatra
    sudo gem install sinatra-static-assets
    ruby inspector.rb

You can also use [Passenger][] to deploy the application on a sub-path of an Apache server. There is a Rack-compliant `config.ru` file in the root of the folder.
